\section{Results and Discussion}
In order to compare several methods (architecture, feature selection), we train on the ABIDE dataset
with a systematic method proposed below.

First, we split the dataset into a training (90\%), validation (10\%) a test set (10\%).
Then, we train the model on the training set and evaluate the model on the test set.

    Single architectures are composed of a single hidden layer with a given number of neurons $h$.
    \textit{Dense} architecture refer to a fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer.
    \textit{Cheb} architectures refer to the graph convolution architecture, we vary the dropout rate $dr$
    during training.}
